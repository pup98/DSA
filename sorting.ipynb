    "Advantages of Bubble Sort:\n",
    "* Bubble sort is easy to understand and implement.\n",
    "* It does not require any additional memory space.\n",
    "* It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that elements with the same key value maintain their relative order in the sorted output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Bubble Sort:\n",
    "* Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(N2) which makes it very slow for large data sets.\n",
    "* Bubble sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm, which means that it requires a comparison operator to determine the relative order of elements in the input data set. It can limit the efficiency of the algorithm in certain cases."
